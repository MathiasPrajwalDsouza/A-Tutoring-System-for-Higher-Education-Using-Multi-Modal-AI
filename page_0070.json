A neural network performs pattern recognition by first undergoing a training session during which the network is repeatedly presented with a set of input patterns along with the category to which each particular pattern belongs. Later, the network is presented with a new pattern that has not been seen before, but which belongs to the same population of patterns used to train the network. The network is able to identify the class of that particular pattern because of the information it has extracted from the training data.Pattern recognition performed by a neural network is statistical in nature, with the patterns being represented by points in a multidimensional decision space. The decision space is divided into regions, each one of which is associated with a class. The decision boundaries are determined by the training process.The construction of these boundaries is made statistical by the inherent variability that exists within and between classes.\n",
