The bat perceives \"shape\" in terms of the arrival time of echoes from different reflecting surfaces (glints) within the target. For this to occur, frequency information in the echo spectrum is converted into estimates of the time structure of the target.Experiments conducted by Simmons and coworkers on the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, critically identify this conversion process as consisting of parallel time-domain and frequency-totime-domain transforms whose converging outputs create the common delay of range axis of a perceived image of the target. It appears that the unity of the bat's perception is due to certain properties of the transforms themselves, despite the separate ways in which the auditory time representation of the echo delay and frequency representation of the echo spectrum are initially performed. Moreover, feature invariances are built into the sonar image-forming process so as to make it essentially independent of the target's motion and the bat's own motion.",

Indeed, satisfactory answers to these issues are usually found through an exhaustive experimental study for a specific appllication of interest, with the designer of the neural network becoming an essential part of the structural learning loop.\n",

            "Some Final Remarks",
            "The issue of knowledge representation in a neural network is directly related to that of",
            "network architecture. Unfortunately, there is no well-developed theory for optimizing",
            "the architecture of a neural network required to interact with an environment of inter-",
            "est, or for evaluating the way in which changes in the network architecture affect the rep-",
            "resentation of knowledge inside the network. Indeed, satisfactory answers to these issues",
            "are usually found through an exhaustive experimental study for a specific appllication of",
            "interest, with the designer of the neural network becoming an essential part of the struc-",

            "Just as there are different ways in which we ourselves learn from our own surrounding",
            "environments, so it is with neural networks. In a broad sense, we may categorize the learn-",
            "ing processes through which neural networks function as follows: learning with a teacher",
            "and learning without a teacher. By the same token, the latter form of learning may be sub-",
            "categorized into unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. These different forms",
            "of learning as performed on neural networks parallel those of human learning.",
            "Learning with a Teacher",
            "Learning with a teacher is also referred to as supervised learning. Figure 24 shows a block",
            "diagram that illustrates this form of learning. In conceptual terms, we may think of the",
            "teacher as having knowledge of the environment, with that knowledge being repre-",
            "sented by a set of input-output examples. The environment is, however, unknown to the",
            "neural network. Suppose now that the teacher and the neural network are both exposed",
            "to a training vector (i.e., example) drawn from the same environment. By virtue of built-in"
